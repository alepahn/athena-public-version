James Open BC self-gravity
======

Implementation of the James algorithm on the public version of Athena++.

Enables self-gravity with open boundary condition in either Cartesian or **cylindrical** coordinates (in 3-D).

Method paper:  **[Moon, Kim, & Ostriker (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..241...24M/abstract)**.

### Usage                                                                                  
* To activate open BC self-gravity, compile with `--grav=obc -fft -mpi`                     
* Note that the serial version is not implemented; if you want to run with single core, do $mpirun -np 1
